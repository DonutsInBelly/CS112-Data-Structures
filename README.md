# Disclaimer
I'm totally aware that some of this code doesn't work. I broke it so that people don't straight up copy my stuff and not learn anything. The idea is for people to fix the bug to gain some understanding of how each assignment should work. Friendship Graph is another story; my friend wrote most of that and named things very arbitrarily to the point where I don't remember what most of it means. If people want to use this code to help them write their own, that's fine. I learned how to code the same way. I am against people copying and pasting code without first trying to understand it.
